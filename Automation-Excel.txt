parent frame- when we use driver.switchTo().parentFrame()-it will go to iframe parent
default frame-when use driver.switchto().defaultcontent()-It will switch to default content in the window

approach-driver.switchto().frame(number)

WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();
WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();

findElement()-returns first element(when multiple elements there)

 throws exception when no element is present   
           
findelements()-returns all the elements

do not through exception

File not found exception- it is raised when file not access or opened

InterruptedException-It is thrown when a thread is waiting,sleeping

IO Exception-it is thrown when an input-output operation is failed

to handle popups:

driver.getwindowhandle()-when web page is loaded we can handled main window by using it
driver.getwindowhandles()-for windows-

javascriptexecutor js = javascriptexecutor driver
js.executeScript(windows.scrollby(0,250)


javascriptexecutor js = javascriptexecutor driver
js.executeScript(document.getelementbyid(user).value='tester');

Switch to a specific window::>

ArrayList<String> newTab=new ArrayList<String>(driver.getWindowHandles());
// driver.switchTo().window(newTab.get(1));
arrayist-add and access data
linkedlist-we can munuplate the data
hashset-it has unique data
hashmap-a very useful data structure for mapping some arbitary data

-To count no of links in page we use find elements method


List<WebElement>links=driver.findElements(By.tagname("a");
system.out.println("no of links" +links.size)

Tags: if we need execute or skip particular scenario or under a specific test that we use tags

Absolute Path:It contains complete path from root element
it start from / 
Relative path:It contains path from reference element to desired element
it start from //


locators:
id,name,tagname,classname,linktext,partial linktext,xpath,css selectors


WebElement:any thing that present on page is webelement


get()-It is used to navigate particular url and wait until the page load
put()-It is used to navigate particular url and wait do not until the page load

alias:these are used to give tempory name to table or column


try:try statement define code block to run
catch:defines code block to handle error
finally:it is defines runs regardless of result

Dta driven framework:it is nothing but the input values are read from data files and store values in script

Final:It is keyword which used in varible method class which we can not change after declareing

finally :it is ablock that run even we get exception or not
finalize:it is method in java which is used to peform clean up just before object is garbage collected

Access modifiers:these are keyswords in object-oriented languages
public, privite,protected and default
