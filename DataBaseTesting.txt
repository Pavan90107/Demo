Defect Life Cycle:The Tester will raise the defect it will go to test lead he will review the defect, if he think the defect is valid means then he will assign developer
 then developer will work on the defect then defect status is in development once fixing has been done ,developer will assign the defect to build team, build team deploe defect in testing environment
test lead/test team test the defect if think defect is working fine he will close the defect

Defect:defect is ntg but variation between expected and actual result is known as defect
Tester will raise defect the defect status will be new and it will go to test lead test lead will verify the defect and then if it is valid means he will assign it to the develope then developer will develop the defect that the defect status is dveloping and then developer he will
Then developer will assign to build team here build team will deploy the defect to test lead lead or tester so that the defect is test by tester if he think that defect got resolved he marks that as close 

Defect:Defect means variance actual and expected result
tester will raise the defect
-it will go test lead
-then the if defect is valid then he will send it to developer
developer will develop the defect here defect is in development status
then after developer send it to build team build team will diployeit to qa team
-then team lead or tester will test the defect then if think defect got resolve then he close it
-if think defect is still there then he will reopen the defect the defect status is reopened

DataBaseTesting:

It is a software testing that checks tables,schema,triggers etc

Types:

WhiteBoxTesting 

-In white box testing we have schema testing:it is ng but dealing structure of the table
-check database schema
-check table naming
-checking no of columns
-checking column names
-checking datatype
-checking size of columns
-checking null fields
-column keys checking

show tables;
information_schema
Metadata:Data about the data

storedprocedure:
already stored code which we can use again and again
-block of multiple sql commonds

-It will execute all commonds at one go
Delimiter
create procedure ABC()
begin
---;
---;
---;
end//
delimiter;


For customer table:
delimiter//
create procedure selectAllCustomers()
begin
select * from customers;
end//
delimiter;

call SelectAllCustomers();

For calling one parameter
delimiter//
create procedure selectAllCustomersByCity(In mycity varchar(50))
begin
select * from customers where city=mycity;
end//
delimiter;

call SelectAllCustomersByCity('Singapore');

For calling two parameter
For calling one parameter
delimiter//
create procedure selectAllCustomersByCity(In mycity varchar(50), In Pcode varchar(50))
begin
select * from customers where city=mycity and postal code=Pcode;
end//
delimiter;

call SelectAllCustomersByCity('Singapore');
For IN-OUT
delimeter //
create procedure get_order_by_cust(
In Cust_no Int,
OUT shipped INT,
OUT Canceled INT,
OUT resolved INT,
OUT disputed INT)

Scenario for storedprocedure:
Check storedprocodure exists in database
Checking wheather Storeprocedure with valid input data
Check stored results as expected
Checking wheather it inserting data properly or not
Checking wheather updating data or not
Checking delete data or not
Checking calling procedure from another stored procedure


Triggers:
A Trigger is My sql object that activates when an event occurs
-must be unique within a database

Before-Insert
Before-Update
Before-Delete
After-Insert
After-Update
After-Delete

Insert,update,delete(either before and after)

syntax:Create trigger triggername
Before insert on employee
For each row
Insert into employees_audit()

For multiple trigger

We use 
Delimiter //
syntax:Create trigger triggername
Before insert on employee
For each row
Begin
Insert into employees_audit()
End//
Delimiter//

Trigger Testing Scenarios:
-Checking wheather trigger update data correctly once they have executed
-Wheather the required conventions have been followed during codeing phase of triggers
validation of insert/update/delete functionality
-Show Trigger() is used open triggers

 in schema we have table,table columns,views,storedprocedure,functions and triggers
and BlackBoxTesting

in black box we have

- functional
in this DML Operations
GUI
DataMapping
DataIntegrity
keys

 and non functional testings
Performance testing
security testing
